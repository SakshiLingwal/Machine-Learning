                                    Malware Attack Detection and Mitigation System
      =>Overview
      This repository contains a machine learning-based project designed to detect malware in incoming traffic files. The system aims to enhance security by 
      identifying potentially harmful files and mitigating malware attacks.
      
      =>Workflow and Execution Flow
      *Jupyter Notebook: An open-source, interactive web application.
          Allows users to create and share documents containing live code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text.
          Widely used in data science and machine learning due to its versatility and user-friendly interface.

              Model Workflow
    1.Data Exploration:
        Check for null values in the dataset.
    2.Examine the distribution of the target variable (indicating whether a file is malicious or benign).
    3.Handling Imbalanced Data:
        Address class imbalances using resampling techniques (e.g., oversampling, undersampling).
    5.Feature Selection and Target Variable Definition:
        Separate features (input variables) from the target variable (malicious or benign).
    6.Data Splitting:
    Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
                Model Training:
    Train three different models:
    1.Random Forest
    2.Decision Tree
    3.K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN)
