                                    Malware Attack Detection and Mitigation System
      =>Overview
      This repository contains a machine learning-based project designed to detect malware in incoming traffic files. The system aims to enhance security by 
      identifying potentially harmful files and mitigating malware attacks.It can be deployed into firewalls which then enhance the capabilities of firewalls.

      *Jupyter Notebook:used for execution of the code.
      =>Model Workflow
      1.Data Exploration:
          Check for null values in the dataset.
      2.Examine the distribution of the target variable (indicating whether a file is malicious or benign).
      3.Handling Imbalanced Data:
          Address class imbalances using resampling techniques (e.g., oversampling, undersampling).
      5.Feature Selection and Target Variable Definition:
          Separate features (input variables) from the target variable (malicious or benign).
      6.Data Splitting:
      Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
                  Model Training:
      Train three different models:
      1.Random Forest
      2.Decision Tree
      3.K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN)
      Note:The ML model is based on PE_section dataset as it gives more accuracy than the other one,but if you are a beginner like me then do try for 
      other dataset as well.
