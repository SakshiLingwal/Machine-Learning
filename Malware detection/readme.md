                                    Malware Attack Detection and Mitigation System
=>Overview
This repository contains a machine learning-based project designed to detect malware in incoming traffic files. The system aims to enhance security by 
identifying potentially harmful files and mitigating malware attacks.

=>Workflow and Execution Flow
*Jupyter Notebook: An open-source, interactive web application.
    Allows users to create and share documents containing live code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text.
    Widely used in data science and machine learning due to its versatility and user-friendly interface.

Model Workflow
1.Data Exploration:
    Check for null values in the dataset.
2.Examine the distribution of the target variable (indicating whether a file is malicious or benign).
3.Handling Imbalanced Data:
    Address class imbalances using resampling techniques (e.g., oversampling, undersampling).
5.Feature Selection and Target Variable Definition:
    Separate features (input variables) from the target variable (malicious or benign).
6.Data Splitting:
    Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
#Model Training:
Train three different models:
1.Random Forest
2.Decision Tree
3.K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN)

#Model Evaluation:
1.Make predictions using the trained models.
2.Evaluate model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
#Result Analysis:
1.Analyze model strengths and weaknesses.
2.Documentation and Reporting:
    Document the entire process in a Jupyter Notebook.
    Summarize key findings and insights.
#Flow of Execution
1.Features are extracted from the dataset.
2.The dataset is split into training and testing sets.
3.Models (Random Forest, Decision Tree, K-NN) are trained and fitted.
4.The performance of each model is evaluated.
5.The overall process is documented in the Jupyter Notebook.
